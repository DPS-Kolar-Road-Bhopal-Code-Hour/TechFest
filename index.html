                            Gulab jamun is an Indian dessert of fried dough balls that are soaked in a sweet, sticky
                            sugar syrup. As per tradition, the syrup has a delicate rose flavour: Gulab means 'rose
                            water' and jamun refers to a berry of a similar size and colour. It is a milk based sweet.
                            Paneer Kulcha is a North Indian food dish, served hot. It contains Cottage Cheese pieces
                            with Gravy consisting of numerous spices which give a tangy taste. Kulcha is a flatbread
                            which contain floor, sometimes stuffing, and is layered with butter. This food item leaves a
                            really good taste in mouth. The Kulcha is cooked in earthen clay oven, giving it a unique
                            taste. It is a notorious dish all over the Indian Subcontinent.
                            A dosa is a cooked flat thin layered rice batter, originating from the South India, made
                            from a fermented batter. Its main constituents are rice and black gram base together in a
                            fine, smooth batter with a dash of salr. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with
                            sambar, a filling of potatoes, and chutney. They can be consumed with idli podi as well.
                            Dosas are a typical part of the Southern Indian and Sri Lankan Tamil diets, but the dish is
                            now popular each over the Indian Subcontinent.

                            chinese food item made since imperial times. It is characterized by its thin crispy skin.
                            The authentic versions of the dish has mostly skin and less amount of meat. It additionally
                            makes use of spring onion and hoisin sauce.
                            DDumpling is China`s oldest conventional pasta, derived from the town of nanyang. I. It is a
                            spring festival food and it is a folk tradition to eat it. Their taste depends upon filling,
                            but they are great to eat regardless of filling. Wonton soup is a standard of Chinese
                            cuisine and made from seasoned chicken broth with filled wontons. Wontons are an Asian
                            equivalent of ravioli or tortellini when they are folded around a spiced meat mixture.

                            Callaloo is a vegetable dish, which has many versions and is from the Carribean. The main
                            ingredient is usually Amaranth, Taro leaves or Xanthosoma leaves. It is served everywhere in
                            the world by us, but it has less availibility.
                            Conch Fritters are famous dish of Bahamas in carribean. It uses conch meat with batter of
                            flour and egg and is rare. We only serve it in Carribean countries due to its rarity. It has
                            no fishy taste and is sweet and mild in flavour. Mofongo is a delicious dish that entices
                            both the palate and fiery discussions about its origin. Mofongo is made with fried green
                            plantains that are mashed with garlic and a mixture of meat or seafood, and is typically
                            served with a side of fried meat and broth. It is mainly from Puerto Rico.
